## Issue

Suggestions for introducing new features, bug reports, and any other suggestions can be written in the issue. They will be reviewed immediately.

## Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please **ask first** if somebody else is already working on this, or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for **pg-differ**. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

Please also provide a **test plan**, i.e. specify how you verified that your addition works.

## Getting started
